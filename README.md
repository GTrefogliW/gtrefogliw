Hello!

My name is Guillermo Trefogli, I am a Master in Public Policy candidate at The University of Chicago. In this space, I want to share with you some samples of the work I have done using data analysis and programming skills.

[Project 1: Crimes, guns, and mental health in Chicago](https://github.com/GTrefogliW/Crime-guns-and-mental-health-in-Chicago)

I worked in this project with Earnest Salgado, my partner and classmate at the Harris School. We performed some exploratory analysis to have a first approximation to the relationship between crimes and guns and mental health in the city of Chicago. What we did? We selected datasets related to these topics, subset the datasets, tidy them, made interactive plots in shiny to show the prominence of crimes in the city, along with those of other indicators (income, poverty rates, etc.). We also performed some text processing and analysis (webscrapping and sentiment) to explore the treatment of crimes, guns, and mental health in the media. The shiny of the project can be found here: https://esalgado.shinyapps.io/final-project-salgadoe/. Further details can be found in the repository of the project.
