Hello!

My name is Guillermo Trefogli, I am an Master in Public Policy candidate at The University of Chicago. In this space, I want to share with you some samples of the work I have done using data analysis and programming skills.

[Project 1: Crimes, guns, and mental health in Chicago](https://github.com/datasci-harris/final-project-salgadoe/blob/main/README.md)

I worked in this project with my partner Earnest Salgado, classmate at the Harris School. We performed some exploratory analysis to have a first approximation to the relationship between crimes, guns, and mental health in the itiy of Chicago. What we did? We selected datasets related to these topics, subset the datasets, cleaned them, made interactive plots in shiny to show the prominence of crimes in the city, along with those of other indicators (income, poverty rates, etc.). We also performed some text processing and analysis to explore the treatment of crimes and its relationship with guns and mental health in the media. Further details are in the repository of the project.
