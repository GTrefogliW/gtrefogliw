Hello!

My name is Guillermo Trefogli, I am a Master in Public Policy candidate at The University of Chicago. In this space, I want to share with you some samples of the work I have done using data analysis and programming skills.

[Project 1: Crimes, guns, and mental health in Chicago](https://github.com/GTrefogliW/Crime-guns-and-mental-health-in-Chicago) (shiny [here](https://esalgado.shinyapps.io/final-project-salgadoe/))

I worked in this project with Earnest Salgado, my partner and classmate at the Harris School. We performed some exploratory analysis to have a first approximation to the relationship between crimes and guns and mental health in the city of Chicago in the summer of 2019. What we did? We selected datasets related to these topics, subset the datasets, tidy them, made interactive plots in shiny to show the prominence of crimes in the city, along with those of other indicators (income, poverty rates, etc.). We also performed some text processing and analysis (webscrapping and sentiment) to explore the treatment of crimes, guns, and mental health in the media. Further details can be found in the repository of the project.

[Project 2: Predicting hotel booking classification using machine learning](https://github.com/GTrefogliW/Classification---Hotel-booking-cancellations)

I worked in this project with Xinyi Gu and Xingue Fang for a Machine Learning class at the Booth School of Business. We apply neural networks, tree model, random forest and boosting models to predict booking cancellations. We compare these models based on its performance using AUC. We choose the best model to predict booking cancellations and provide recommendations to compannies within this industry to apply machine learning tools to approach the problem of booking cancellations to ultimately maximize profits. Further details can be found in the repository of the project.
